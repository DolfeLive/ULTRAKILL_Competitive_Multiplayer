A Ultrakill mod for PVP using Steamworks for multiplayer

TODO:
```
Player Models
More things to sync
Load assetbundles from the mod internally
More settings and persistant settings config
when you die dont go to main menu
Make a bunch of the cybergrind code and other bits async
```

Planned:
```
gamemode with 2 modes: you start with only arms + piercer, guns and variations will fall from the sky and when you pick them up it gets equipped and thats what you have to fight with, mode 2: custom guns will fall from the sky etc m1 garrand
Voice chat
Arena changes during the match
Death cam (you can see last few seconds b4 enem kills you)
Harmony patches for everything needed
optional rounds system

```

Possible ideas:
```
players deal hard damage
players have 200 health instead of 100? or just guns dmg gets nerfed in pvp
Forces to keep players near arena
```

Need ideas for:
```
Respawning

```

Rejected ideas ( i made them and discord said no):
```
Passive healing

```

What it does: 
```
Uses https://github.com/DolfeLive/MultiplayerUtil for multiplayer
Supports using steam app id 480
Has (lobby creation/searching/joining) set up
Toggleable lobby mod support and cheats
```
